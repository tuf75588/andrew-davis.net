this is a test of writing mdx files within gatsby, these files will eventually
default to a template component to render their respective layouts according to
what is being written inside of them.

There will be one template for "posts" and one for "projects" posts will be things like
blog postings and "projects" will have relevant information about projects I have been working
on and/or completed.
