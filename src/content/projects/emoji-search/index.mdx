Emojis have become a cornerstone of communication today, but it can sometimes be a bit hard to have them readily accessible and ready to go when we need them.

I wanted to make a web application that would allow me to not only search for a particular emoji I wanted to use, but also be able to copy it too.

React was an obvious choice for me in building this application, as I knew it would fit my needs quite well.

I was able to find a very large JSON file containing not only emojis symbols, but also keywords and a brief description of each which would help the results of searching for any particular one much more elastic and accurate.

The final task was adding the functionality of being able to clipboard copy and emoji you would like to use. The package I chose for this is <XA href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/clipboard">clipboard</XA> which simply requires a DOM node reference, and then allows for the contents of that node to be copied.

While this application is relatively simple in its concept, it has provided a ton of utility to me to this day. Windows has since made accessing emojis much easier, I still find myself using this app when I need access to a catalog of emojis in a pinch.
