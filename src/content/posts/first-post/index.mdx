    Thanks so much for visiting my little corner of the internet. This blog will
    be dedicated to documenting some of my thoughts about development, life, and
    all things in between. My hope is to share things in the field of web
    development I find especially interesting and detail some of the personal
    struggles of someone trying to find their first professional job in the
    field. This is the first blog I will be managing myself, and will do my best
    to keep myself accountable for keeping it updated regularly.

    I'm hoping that documenting my thoughts and ideas about things will
    ultimately prove to be a healthy endeavor for me and perhaps encourage
    others to do the same. Until next time, I look forward to this new journey
    and hope you all will join me for the ride!
